      <br><br>
      <b>Gallery 1: Modernism and Modern Heritage</b>
      <br>
      The Modern Movement across the world can be traced across a vast spread of period between the beginnings of the industrial age in the west to the colonial and post-colonial contexts in Asia and other regions. The regional variations and adaptations of this movement in each area and country contributed to a range of architectural idioms and new vocabularies. Modern architecture in India is marked through a Nation building process reflected in the design of Chandigarh along with innovative designs for educational and cultural institution as well as residential design. This gallery exhibits few of the masterpieces of modern institutions in India which are significant to be categorised under Modern Heritage of India.
      <br><br>
      <b>Gallery 2: Panjab University and Pierre Jeanneret</b>
      <br>
      While Jeanneret’s primary purpose in 15 years of his stay in Chandigarh was to execute the vision of his cousin Le Corbusier, his own evolution as an architect conversant with indigenous solutions was showcased in a range of planning and architectural works in Chandigarh and other towns. Panjab University stands as an exemplar of Pierre Jeanneret’s expression in modern campus planning while simultaneously addressing the dictates of a harsh climate, a shoestring budget and near absence of mechanized means of construction.
      <br><br>
      <b>Gallery 3: Documenting Gandhi Bhawan</b>
      <br>
      Gandhi Bhawan is an iconic sculptural masterpiece of a building designed by Pierre Jeanneret at the peak of his professional practice. This gallery presents some of the initial documentation work undertaken for the Gandhi Bhawan.

      <span style="font-size:18px; color: #333"><b><u>Theme and Content of Exhibition 2 on Conservation of Cement Concrete and Modern Heritage in India</span></u></b>
      <br><br>
      The contribution of Pierre Jeanneret to Modern architecture and Chandigarh stands as undisputed as his efforts in realising the vision of the Capitol Complex on ground at Chandigarh for his first cousin Le Corbusier. This display is part of the exhibition series that is being developed during the course of research and conservation planning for the Gandhi Bhawan under the 1Keeping it Modern• Grant, Getty Foundation, USA.

      <b>Gallery 2: Panjab University and Gandhi Bhawan</b>
      <br>
      This gallery presents a brief summary of physical issues that have emerged in some of the historic buildings in the Panjab University Campus. It also introduces the Gandhi Bhawan as an iconic sculptural masterpiece of a building designed by Pierre Jeanneret at the peak of his professional practice. Some of the initial documentation work undertaken for the Gandhi Bhawan has been showcased in this gallery.
      <br><br>
      <b>Gallery 3 and Gallery 4: Gandhi Bhawan Conservation: Mapping and Assessment</b>
      <br>
      The Gandhi Bhawan, constructed in 1962 has remained largely intact despite some alterations in the past to keep up with the changing needs of the building. Having completed 54 years, the building does show some signs of distress. The exhibits in this gallery show the methods used for assessing conditions of various exterior and interior elements of Gandhi Bhawan. A number of techniques have been adopted including visual and mechanical surveys to identify the issues. The laser scanning documentation, Radar and Infrared surveys are also being supported by archival drawings and documentation, including the original specifications approved for the building. These assessments help in understanding probable causes and current conditions for future treatments to be proposed in the Conservation Plan for Gandhi Bhawan.
