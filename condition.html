    <b><u>Landscape Condition Assessment </u></b>
  </span>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The assessment has been conducted under the following landscape components: </p>
  <ol style="text-align: left; width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;">
    <li>
      The man-made elements : 
      <ul style="text-align: left; width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;">  
        <li> The pool and it's structure.</li>
        <li> External building services, especially those that are connected to the pool – water-supply, drainage, over-flow, RW discharge system </li>
      </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>
      The natural elements : 
      <ul style="text-align: left; width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;">  
        <li> Trees</li>
        <li> Ground</li>
        <li> Water</li>
      </ul>  
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">The significance of the pool extends beyond its conceptual relevance to substantiate the abstraction of the idea of the building being a lotus with its reflection doubling the dimensions in the pool. The pool has other advantages linked to rainwater harvesting from roof and surroundings, water storage, micro-climate amelioration, guides entry movement as access control by acting as a moat, eliminates ground disturbances around the building in accordance with its use and delineates the site boundary to retain the ‘view-shed’. In essence, the pool layout strongly delineates both physical and visual extents of the site to limit chances of future encroachments into its apparent zone of vision. <br> A careful analysis of the volume of pool vis-a-vis the annual rain water harvesting potential of the roof-top and terraces of the building reveals the rationality of the pool size as the volume is only about 40% of the total RWH potential. This assessment, given in the following Table, takes into account the pool area as well since this is also part of the total catchment.

  <p style="text-align: justify;">The above analysis clearly indicates that rain water as the source of water supply may be sufficient enough, even after accounting for first flush and evaporation loss. However, the challenge would lie in maintaining the water quality in the pool through out the year.
  </p>
  <h1>IMAGES</h1>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The main issues related to the pool are drainage of the tank and water logging at places, water supply round the year as pool remains empty due to inadequate availability of water, water augmentation through rainwater harvesting needs to be developed. Furthermore, the empty pool area is vulnerable to littering and static water leading to risk of mosquito breeding. <br> Condition assessment of the vegetation of the core site and the surrounding areas indicate that the Royal Palms (Roystanea regia) around the south and west of the Gandhi Bhawan were taken up in the early 1970s. The choice appears rational as these palms would generate minimum leaf litter yet offer clear visibility of the building. Most of the other trees in the adjoining area are also evergreen and thus, with similar advantage. The over-all site landscape forms a bold layout with clear lines and large expanses of grass and water that are characteristically opposite yet naturally complementary. <br> The light sculpture designed as a repetitive element for all the three decks indicate the original intent of lighting being of indirect i.e. light source not visible, up lighting and with warm colour impact, as was with then existing lamp technology (GLS lamps). The walls, base and surround of the pool are all cast in cement concrete and have been repaired, re-surfaced, replaced and re-pointed in the past few years. Problems with water stagnation, evaporation etc. has led to the surface being degraded significantly over time. Waterproofing of the pool’s base was initiated but it not clear how successful it has been. The toe wall of the pool is also in distress in some areas due to continuous seepage from the surrounding lawn areas. This is an issue exacerbated during monsoons. </p>
