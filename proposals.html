    <span style="font-size:18px; color: #333"><b><u>Landscape Conservation Plan</b></u></span><br>
    <span class="text-justify">
      <p>
The pool setting filled with water for reflection of Gandhi Bhawan along with
other supportive aspects explained under condition assessment is the most
essential requirement for landscape and overall conservation works in Gandhi
Bhawan. This is also one of the most challenging proposals. Hence, it has been
suggested that in the 1 st phase complete waterproofing of pool be undertaken as
per specifications (in drawings). Subsequently the water should be filled in the
pool and monitoring be carried out for one year to observe seepage and water
retention issues along with its impact on the microclimate. Any further works for
implementation may only be carried out after completion of this monitoring.
<br>
More detailed proposal for each are is listed below.</p></span>

<span style="font-size:18px; color: #333"><b><u>Conservation of Exteriors and Interiors</b></u></span>

<br>
<span class="text-justify">
<p>Based on the various surveys and condition assessment of each element carried
on site, the conservation plan determines the nature and composition of material
and modes of intervention for long-term conservation of each. The assessment of
its condition is supported by recommended treatment and prioritization based
on the identified issues. Detailed drawings of each area are part of the
conservation management plan while the primary points are summarized in
Table B on next page. Conditions have been grouped based on severity and level
of intervention and priorities for intervention have been identified on this basis
as below:
<br>
<ul>
 <li><b>P1: VERY HIGH</b><br>
These include conditions, which require immediate attention, and if left
unaddressed or uncorrected, could be a threat to life safety. In addition to the
life threat these also include conditions which are could cause the material
fabric to disintegrate and result in irreplaceable loss.</li>

<li><b>P2: HIGH</b><br>
Conditions that could result in failure of materials and could become severe.
These should be addressed after the urgent conditions have been taken care</li>

<li><b> P3: MEDIUM</b><br>
Deteriorated conditions that don’t need urgent intervention and can be planned
for and appropriate time in the future. If left unaddressed it could lead to a
water proofing issue.</li>

<li><b> P4: LOW</b><br>
Conditions that have been addressed in the past but still require intervention
either due to failure or due to aesthetic concerns

<li><b> P5: AESTHETIC</b><br>
A treatment necessary to remedy a condition that affects the appearance but
not the integrity or performance of the material.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Based on the detailed assessment carried out in Section 5, the treatment for
conservation of exterior and interior materials is recommended as below. In a
number of cases , it is essential to prepare mock ups before undertaking any
treatment to decide the final process. Mock ups for exterior panels have been
initiated as part of this plan preparation and few more mock ups are proposed to be
conducted before the finalization of this draft plan. The suggested treatments need
to be read in conjunction with the drawings for each area/elevation/plan in the Part
B of this report. Some sample drawings are also included in this section

Use and Interpretation Plan

Gandhi Bhawan has retained its original use to a large extent serving as an

important venue for discussions related to the Institute of the Gandhian Studies.

During the preparation of this Conservation Management Plan, the Gandhi

Bhawan auditorium was used extensively to host all workshops and conferences

associated with the plan preparation. The University hosts several functions and

events at this auditorium throughout the year. However, the conference room

and library need to be used to a larger extent. In addition, additionally,

interpretation of Gandhi Bhawan and its significance needs to be displayed

through expressions such as the original model of Gandhi Bhawan by Pierre

Jeanneret, interactive database showing all conducted research on Gandhi

Bhawan to visitors and static displays/panels along with signage explaining the

significance of each space. More recently, Gandhi Bhawan has observed a greater

footfall of national and international visitors along with architecture and art

students fascinated with Modernist forms.

The exterior entrance space which is often used for food and beverages in an

adhoc manner during an event needs to be relocated across the garden form the

entrance to facilitate a better allocation for such activities and to retain the

ambience of Gandhi Bhawan. Architect’s Office at PU has already prepared such a

plan that may be implemented.

In the interior spaces, most of the furniture and layout is retained. Colour

scheme needs to be retained as per original. Furnishings such as blinds/ curtains

need to be more sensitive. A detailed use plan along with some proposals is

outlined here including a Universal Access Plan developed after survey by a

visually impaired intern from DRONAH. Functional and operational aspects such

as services and lighting need to be addressed too.

Proposal for Universal Access Plan

The “universal Access Plan” for Gandhi Bhawan Chandigarh ensures the easy

navigation within the premises of the building, easy access to the building and

the access to all the murals, photographs and paintings within the building. This

building not only reminds us of the Gandhian Philosophy but it itself is a

wonderful work of Modern architecture. Hence, we will have to make this

building accessible for each visitor. In this plan, we will incorporate various

solutions, which can make this site universally accessible for all.

Issue: The main access road in front of the building does not have any

directional signage to entre in the building. In addition, there is no information

signage at the entrance for the visitors to get the overview of site.

Recommendation: Need of Tactile Paths: There should be metal speed bumps

on the access road in front of the Gandhi Bhawan, which will work as an

indicator for visually impaired visitors if they come alone. This speed bump will

let the visitor know that Gandhi Bhawan is just in front of them and they will

have to take the right turn to reach the tactile path, which will lead them to the

gate. At the main entrance of Gandhi Bhawan, there should be three roots of

tactile paths. First, it will go to the left until the water cooler and then turn right

from there to reach committee room in between and then lead to the

washrooms. This tactile path will also run in both the wash rooms- the ladies and

the gents. Another path will run straight to the Auditorium. The third path will

run to the right of the main entrance, which will lead the visually impaired

visitor to the library. These tactile paths are very important because it is

extremely helpful for a blind person to move around. These paths provide easy

navigation that helps to walk freely and independently.

Issue: The library does not have any database to find the books for the users.

There is no provision of the tactile path, universal access signage within and

around the building for the visitor)

Recommendation: Installation of a computer in library: There should be a

computer installed in the library with the screen reading softwares (JAWS or

NVDA). It is also suggested that some of the important books should be provided

in the E format (.docs, .doc, .pdf, e-pup ETC) so that a visually impaired person

can also read them with the help of the installed computer and can have the

glance of Gandhian philosophies. The installation of a computer with the screen

reading software will make the library accessible for every visitor, so if they

want to learn or know something they can easily go to the library and refer the

prescribed book for it.

Audio Description of the Murals and Photographs: It is recommended that an

audio description should be provided of all the Murals and the Photographs of

Gandhi so that a blind visitor can feel and understand that how do the

photographs look like. If possible we can also provide the tactile paintings of

some important photographs which can be touched and felt with a touch of the

hands. These paintings can be made like the paintings already there in the

National Museum Institute ‘Anubhav Gallery’. These audio/tactile description of

the various photographs and the Mural will be extremely helpful a blind visitor

to understand them better. The first row seats of the auditorium should be

reserved for the physically challenged persons as they will not be able to climb

up for the upper rows. Most of the activities take place on the ground floor so it is

quite manageable for a physically challenged person to take part in such

activities. All the suggestions provided above are extremely essential for Gandhi

Bhawan to make this site accessible for every visitor.

Signage Strategy

Considering the need for basic signage for the visitors along with interpretation

and universally accessible signage, it is recommended to follow the existing

Modernist vocabulary of signage for Gandhi Bhawan that shows embossed

letters which also serve well for the visually impaired as well as conform to the

modern aesthetics. The letters may be embossed on a stainless steel plate or

alternatively may also be fixed directly on wall surface. Some options are

presented below and in the drawings section. It is hoped that the signage

strategy used for Gandhi Bhawan can be streamlined into the signage strategy

for the entire campus.

The signage type needs to include the following:

1. Directional/ Information Signage – such as ‘Gandhi Bhawan’ existing on the

building or on doors of interiors spaces (Library, Conference room)

2. Interpretation Signage – Signage may have more text to explain the significance/

interpret interiors spaces/ building structure/ mural/artwork etc.

3. Emergency Signage – specifically requires as part of the risk management plan and

need to be of international standards in graphics

Lighting, Infrastructure and Services

Installing state of the art new services and revamping the lighting plan to fit in with

present need and use of Gandhi Bhawan is a major challenge in the building.

Following recommendations are outlined for various services based on the

assessment:

1. Electrical conduits maybe replaced by chasing to be concealed instead of adding to

unsightly superimposed conduits on the wall. Wall plaster is one layer that has lower

significance value and can be compromised for concealing services. However, no

such action is feasible in the flooring, which is of higher value. Conduits should be

documented rigorously to avoid unnecessary interventions into the wall.

2. Lighting equivalent to 500 lux is a requirement. Lighting fixtures are of extremely

high value as per Modernist style in the interiors hence no new light/fan fixture

should be added. Lighting requirement needs to be planned to be covered through

increased lux in the existing cove lights. In case of specific are required lights,

pedestal lights (such as on stage of auditorium) may be used as per requirement. A

lighting plan developed by Architect’s Office, Panjab University is enclosed in the

proposed set of drawings along with some additional inputs.

3. Since the conduits can be placed in the walls, any other service lines

(CCTV/speakers/IT) may also be incorporated in the conduits. It is to be noted that

placement of any fixture has to be done sensitively. Advanced fixtures, which are

more sensitive and smaller/less conspicuous merging with the interiors, are to be

used only.

4. Air-cooling is a major challenge especially in the auditorium space. While a number

of options for air conditioning have been explored by the Architect’s Office

previously and by the project team during preparation of tis conservation plan,

there are limited options for air conditioning that will not result in a deterioration of

value. Hence, it is recommended that monitoring of microclimate and

temperature/humidity be carried out for 1 year after filling the water in the pool.

Moreover, air circulation through skylight and windows is ensured. Any decision

related to air conditioning may only be taken after a complete monitoring with

record of temperature and humidity conditions in each exterior and interior space

(with the presence of pool water and proper air circulation) in all seasons for 1 year.

Archive Management and Presentation

The original drawings that have been located at the Architect’s Office will be

restored by a qualified paper conservator and stored in an appropriate manner

after being digitally reproduced. These should be described in their context and

be presented to audience in an engaging manner to communicate the

significance of Modernist architecture in India and in Chandigarh. The models

that have been located will be presented and protected from damage as part of

the interpretation strategy for Gandhi Bhawan.

INTACH Conservation Institutes team undertook the condition assessment of

architectural drawings in possession of Architecture Department of Punjab

University (Chandigarh).These are mostly architectural and engineering

drawings on tracing paper.

Risk Management

Risk management guidelines were formulated for Gandhi Bhawan based on the

comprehensive risk assessment. These guidelines articulate strategies for mitigating

risks and for emergency preparedness and response in case of any disaster.

Mitigation Measures

For Fire Mitigation:-

 Electrical wiring in the building needs to be upgraded without infringing upon the

visual character of the building.

 Adequate number and quantity of carbon dioxide based fire extinguishers need to be

put in place at adequate places in Gandhi Bhawan as per the drawing. These need to

be regularly inspected and refilled. ABC type dry powder type extinguisher of 4 Kg

each is prescribed for the building.

 Battery operated Smoke detectors need to be installed in the building especially in the

main hall and the library building.

 Adequate arrangements for water supply need to be made.

For Earthquake Mitigation:

 Distressed concrete panels should be fixed again taking into account protection from

lateral movements during earthquakes.

 Regular monitoring of cracks need to be carried out

 All the light fixtures, hangings need to be anchored well so that they do not fall over

or collapse in the event of an earthquake.

For mitigation against heavy rainfall:

 The rainwater and drainage pipes/lines should be regularly cleaned and monitored for

any blockage.

For mitigation against theft and vandalism:

 CCTV Cameras need to be set up at the entrance and in the auditorium and library to

monitor the movements against potential theft or vandalism.

 Adequate number of trained security staff need to be put in place at appropriate

locations during special events.

Evacuation Routes, Refuge area for People and Temporary Salvage/Storage Areas

for Heritage fragments need to be put in place as per the plan.

Essential Equipment for Emergency Response:-

For Search and Rescue:

- Safety Jacket

- Safety Helmet

- Safety Gloves (fire/heat resistant)

- Masks

- Emergency Light / Battery Operated Torches

- Ropes

- CSI Tape (for Cordoning)

- Stretcher

- First Aid Kit (to be identified with the help of a medical professional)

 For Salvaging Collections:-

- Aprons

- Illuminated Jackets (for working in the dark)

- Safety Helmets

- Special rubber gloves for handling collections

- Emergency Light/Batter Operated torches

- Foldable Tent (Gazebo)

- Polythene (plastic) Sheets approximately 40 inches wide.

Emergency Team and its Responsibilities:

 Team consisting of the internal staff of the site, which is supposed to be the first

responder to any emergency, so that it does not turn into a bigger disaster.

 Team-Building and Coordination for effective relief, rescue of visitors / staff and

salvage of objects

 First Few Hours are Crucial.

Key Tasks:

 To undertake first response actions before external emergency services arrive.

 To assist external emergency services when they reach the site

 To undertake key measures to facilitate recovery of the building and objects after

external emergency services leave the site

General Guidelines:

 The staff should be given roles to perform in emergencies according to their expertise

in the field they work with proper command structure.

 The entire staff should know appropriate responses and their roles in an emergency.

 Each emergency team should divide responsibilities among it and should not

concentrate in one activity or location. For example, while some members of

collections team may salvage the collections, others may stay back to take care of

prepare their temporary storage area. However, the team should be ready to plan for

the unexpected.

 Emergency response should involve activating all emergency teams and services and

following necessary procedures by coordinating among various teams.

 Coordination with nearest fire office, police station, hospital and other line

departments should be established beforehand so that they are aware of the shortest

route to the site and have sufficient knowledge of the layout of site.

 The emergency team should hold regular meetings of various team heads for general

review the activities and the status of plan. Each team leader should also convene the

meeting of its respective team members on regular basis to practice and review the

responsibilities of the team.

 Each emergency team leader should have a back-up in case the designated leader is

unable to discharge his or her function due to unforeseen circumstances.

 Procedures should be established for the notification of an emergency, which

is understood by all the staff.

 All the staff members especially the emergency team members should be

well versed with all the areas in the site. They should know the main

evacuation routes as well as the emergency signage.

 The staff members also are aware of the areas that are demarcated for

refuge as well as temporary storage of salvaged collections.

 Special public areas should be demarcated for stationing of emergency

services such as fire, police and ambulance during an emergency situation.

Such areas should be declared as ‘No Parking Areas’ and easily accessibility to

these areas should be ensured all the time.

 It is crucial that each emergency team member is equipped with wireless

device for internal communication. Communication with all the team

members should be feasible through mobile. It is important to check their

connectivity.

 Recovery process should commence only when all safety aspects have been

taken into consideration following a disaster and when the incident has been

declared safe by the proper authorities like police, fire, electricity, building

control etc.

 Response procedures should be for both during and outside business hours,

alerting chain of command including other organizational departments e.g.

security.

Composition of Emergency Team:

 Rescue Team

 Building and Infrastructure Team

 Administration and Supplies Team

 Objects Salvage Team

 Communications Team

Objectives of the Emergency Drill:

 To identify existing strengths and shortcomings in emergency response in

Gandhi Bhawan.

 To familiarize the participants with the response procedures (actions,

duration and sequence and communication channels) and create an

emergency team

 To test proposed emergency preparedness measures (effectiveness of

signage, proposed evacuation routes in terms of movement, time needed).

 To test the emergency communication and coordination with external

agencies such as fire, police, hospital, media etc.

Disaster Scenario and Responsibilities of Emergency Team Members :-

A fire breaks out in the library of Gandhi Bhawan at 5 PM of Friday Evening due to

electric short circuit, when a function is going on in the auditorium with around 50

people in attendance.

1. The library staff tries to extinguish the fire but fails to do so as the fire is

spreading rapidly due to presence of combustible material (paper, books,

furniture). The staff calls the Emergency Team Coordinator (Manish), who

then activates all the internal emergency team heads (Rescue, Building &amp;

Infrastructure, objects salvage, administration/supplies and

communications). He will also call the fire office, police and hospital.

2. Rescue team will first go to evacuate injured people (in the library and lobby)

and other visitors in the auditorium. The people will be brought to the

assembly area (park across the road). The injured will be given first aid (by

the medical officer of PU)

3. Building and Infrastructure team will switch off electricity and activate water

supply source. Supplies team will provide helmets, jackets, gloves etc. to the

rescue team to help with evacuation.

4. Communications team will help in internal communication and external

communication with media and other external agencies like fire office, police,

ambulance etc.

5. Rescue team, Building/infrastructure team and administration/supplies team

members will assist fire, police and hospital staff to conduct evacuation,

control the fire and provide first aid.

6. After the fire and police teams declare the end of emergency,

building/infrastructure team will make inspection and create access for

salvage team to enter and do the operation.

7. Salvage team enters the building, makes rapid damage assessment (through

photographs) for objects damaged by fire and water, prepares plan for

salvage, collects supplies from admin/supplies team and moves collections to

temporary storage area (next to the fine arts museum), security team will

manage the security of access route and temporary storage area. After

moving the collections, the salvage team makes documentation and

condition mapping as per the format.

Emergency Evacuation Plan

Emergency Contacts would consist of the following:-

1. Emergency Team Coordinator

2. Assistant Security Officer (PU) – Head of the Rescue Team

3. Head of Building and Infrastructure Team

4. Head of Objects Salvage Team

5. Head of Communications Team

6. Chief Medical Officer, PU

7. Electricity Officer, PU

8. Water Supply Officer, PU

9. Fire Tenders, Sector 11, Chandigarh

10. Police Station, Sector 11, Chandigarh

11. General Hospital, Sector 16, Chandigarh

Guidelines for Salvage of Heritage Objects:

 Enter the site only if declared safe

 Prepare all relevant information before

 Document the incident

 Prioritize collections to be salvaged and protected in-situ based on their value

and vulnerability.

 Evacuate only if required and if another space is available

 Work in pairs, use safety gear

 Observe minimal intervention

 Debrief and report
